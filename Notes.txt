Here is the output I had and there are a lot of things to fix here, first increase a little bit the complexity of the model so is not randomly guessing but looking for patterns in the market itself for instance Mondays are typically bull days and things like this (this is just an example) but I want the market to behave and understand this example properly and use the AI to predict the future. Also the prediction model is super weird, and is always giving me positive results which is not realistic because some weeks make be down weeks, if this model we using from kaggle is not good enough lets change something as long as is realistic and easy to do. provide me with clear steps and full scripts so I can copy and paste or paste new scripts. Also the visualize.py file is wrong, because the buy and sell marks make literally no sense, it should have a data algorithm that analyzes the market values and picks the most optimal time spaces to buy, sell and hold!
