# 📈 AI Market Predictor

This project leverages artificial intelligence to predict the **next 5 trading days** of market movement, using historical price patterns and machine learning algorithms. It's built to help traders and analysts gain deeper insights into potential short-term trends in the stock market.

## 🔍 Overview

The AI Market Predictor analyzes historical stock price data and uses pattern recognition to forecast whether the market is likely to go up, down, or remain neutral over the next five trading days. It combines technical indicators, price action, and machine learning models to detect subtle patterns that often precede certain market behaviors.

## 🧠 Key Features

- 📊 Inputs historical market data
- 🔎 Detects recurring patterns using AI/ML algorithms
- 📅 Predicts movement for the next **5 market days**
- 📈 Returns directional predictions: **up**, **down**, or **neutral**
- 💡 Modular design for experimentation and tuning

## 🧰 Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas & NumPy
- Scikit-learn / XGBoost / LightGBM (depending on your implementation)
- TensorFlow or PyTorch (for deep learning, if used)
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualizations)
- yfinance or Alpha Vantage (for data collection)

## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Data Collection**: Gathers historical stock data via API.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts technical indicators and pattern features.
3. **Model Training**: Trains an ML model to recognize patterns and outcomes.
4. **Prediction**: Forecasts the next 5 market days for new/unseen data.
5. **Evaluation**: Compares predictions with actual market outcomes for validation.
